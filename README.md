# Nuxt Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm preview

# yarn
yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```

## Content model

Pages are authored in Prismic. The models live in the repo — one directory per
custom type under `customtypes/`, one per slice under `app/slices/` — and
`prismicio-types.d.ts` is the generated TypeScript for them.

The repo is only ever the *local* copy. A model added here does not exist in the
Prismic repository until it is pushed with Slice Machine, and until it is, the
content team has nothing to edit. `prizes` and `contest_rules` are in that state
now: the pages render their built-in content and wait.

Pages are written to survive that gap rather than to depend on it. A singleton
that has never been created reads as a missing document, not an error, and
`/contest-rules` publishes the ADR-0007 eligibility constraints from
`app/utils/eligibilityRules.ts` until someone authors better wording.

`test/unit/vocabulary.test.ts` holds the naming rule from `CONTEXT.md` over
every file that carries copy: no sportsbook vocabulary, anywhere a fan can read
it.

## Database

Postgres, accessed with Drizzle. `DATABASE_URL` is the only variable needed to
connect; copy `.env.example` to `.env` and point it at your local Postgres.

```bash
createdb tfc                # or: docker exec <postgres> createdb -U postgres tfc
pnpm db:migrate             # apply migrations
```

The schema is `server/db/schema.ts`. After changing it, generate a migration and
read the SQL before it runs anywhere:

```bash
pnpm db:generate --name what_it_does
```

Migrations are applied, never edited once committed — a Coin ledger has to be
able to explain how it got to its current shape.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test                   # everything
pnpm test --project unit    # just the fast ones
```

Two projects:

- **`unit`** — logic and configuration. No database, no Nuxt, milliseconds.
- **`server`** — the real Nitro server against a real Postgres, in a container
  started for the run. Nothing is mocked, so a passing test is a statement
  about what the deployed app does. Needs Docker.

Every server test starts from an empty database; `test/setup/database.ts`
arranges that, so no test has to remember to. Reach for `test/helpers` to
arrange state — `createUser()` and friends fill in anything the test is not
about, so what a test *is* about stays readable.
